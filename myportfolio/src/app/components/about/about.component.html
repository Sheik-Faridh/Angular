            Hey, I'm a full-stack javascript developer based in Chennai who
            loves programming, traveling, and cooking. I love creating new
            things that live on the internet. My interest in web development
            started back in 2018 when I was decided to learn Java and C#. These
            programming skills got me an opportunity for JavaScript and then I
            have started to learn the basic fundamentals of web development -
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was really fun and more challenging
            that grabbed me more interest in web development.
          </p>
